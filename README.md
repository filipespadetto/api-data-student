# Student API Data 

The data is based in an API from https://github.com/luizomf/simple_api_rest_sqlite

It is a simple API REST for data consume and manipulation. Follow the link to know about.

In this project, I did use Python to manipulate data through JSON and SQlite to store it locally.

All the data was base on a student management. I made the "CRUD" with the import library using HTTP method, also I downloaded photos via GET HTTP and uploaded photos via POST HTTP.

Lastly, I created a way to use the token authentication consuming from the API and writing in a file to read just when I log in.
